# Javascript Recruitment Task

Javascript recruitment task

## Introduction

This takehome task was developed in order to test the basic skillset of a JavaScript developer.

The task consists of backend and frontend functionalities.

You aren’t expected to spend more than 30-60 minutes on this task (we respect your time, you don’t have to complete the task).

You are free to use the internet but must solve this task yourself.

During your interview you will be asked to present (in any way you like) your thought process on how you went about completing this task.

## How to use

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system.

Verify that the above software has been downloaded correctly by executing the following commands in a terminal:

`git -v`\
`node -v`\
`npm -v`

The above commands should print a version number in the console. If you receive a message like "**X** is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file", it may be because the software has not been added to your PATH system variable. To add the software to the path variable, search “Edit the system environment variables” in the search box. Find the ‘Path’ variable in both the ‘User Variables’ and ‘Environment Variables’ sections and add the install location of the above software (_e.g. C:\Program Files\nodejs_). 


Create a repo in your GitHub account (do not fork via GitHub!).

Then clone the contents of this repo into it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sampuddy/JavaScript-Challenge-master.git
cd JavaScript-Challenge-master
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_github_account/your-repo.git
git push -u origin
```

Install backend dependencies with the command `npm install`.

Run the backend service and serve static files with the command `npm run start`.

You can now begin development. To view and test the changes you have made, save the file and restart the local server by executing `npm run start` again (alternatively, install the ‘Live Server’ VS Code extension, or a similar extension if you are using another IDE, and you can view your changes in realtime).

Once complete share your GitHub repo URL with your company contact.

Then prepare whatever method you would like to present.

## The application

The goal of the application is to display how stock prices change over time.

In this starter template you get:
* A backend application written in `node.js` that serves information about stocks (for the last 10 hours).
* A frontend template that renders an empty chart and static spinner.

Getting stock data has a **10% chance of failure** (by design). The application needs to account for that.

## Mission objectives

* Make the spinner rotate using CSS3.
* Query the backend for list of available stocks.
* Query the backend for data about each stock.
* Hide the spinner after all data is loaded.
* Log to the console the result stock data in a structured way.
* Fix backend (app.js) to return a meaningful error message when stock data cannot be retrieved (now the request just hangs!).

Additional (if you have time)
* Plot the stock data on the chart (as a line chart).

## Constraints

* You are **not** to modify the code in `stocks.js`
* The stocks API is designed to return errors sometimes. The application should gain the ability to cope with that.
* You can use the provided mini-API for canvas operations, but you can also use other solution.
